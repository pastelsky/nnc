#Visualisation of nearest neighbour chain algorithm


##Introduction
This project aims to provide an animated step by step demonstration of how [heirarchial agglomerative clustering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering) can be accomplished using the [nearest neighbour chaining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest-neighbor_chain_algorithm) algorithm .

Coded as a part of Advanced Data Structures project.
