#Visualisation of nearest neighbour chain algorithm

##Introduction
This project aims to provide an animated step by step demonstration of how [heirarchial agglomerative clustering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering) can be accomplished using the [nearest neighbour chaining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest-neighbor_chain_algorithm) algorithm .

Coded as a part of Advanced Data Structures project.

##How it works
* Your laptop/desktop's viewport is considered a blank canvas to which points/nodes can be added. 
* Clustering takes place using [single-linkage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-linkage_clustering) nearest-neighbor clustering.
* The size of the cluster cloud can be modified using the range slider.
* Browser console contains a full trace of the program post clustering.
